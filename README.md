# ONNX Examples

This repository contains three example scripts demonstrating different aspects of working with ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange). ONNX is an open format to represent deep learning models, making it easier to interchange models between various deep learning frameworks.

## Introduction

This repository provides examples for working with ONNX models, showcasing how to:

- Convert a Keras model to ONNX format.
- Convert a scikit-learn model to ONNX format.
- Use pre-trained models from the ONNX Model Zoo.

## Requirements
```
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn onnxruntime onnx
```
or 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run these scripts, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (for the Keras to ONNX conversion)
- scikit-learn (for the scikit-learn to ONNX conversion)
- ONNX Runtime
- ONNX Model Zoo (for the third script)

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/onnx-examples.git
cd onnx-examples
```

- [ONNX Runtime Documentation](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/)

Feel free to explore the scripts and modify them to suit your specific use cases. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please don't hesitate to open an issue in this repository.

Happy ONNX modeling!
